# 4 A Fibonacci sequence is a list of values where each is the sum of the 
# previous two, e.g. [0, 1, 1, 2, 3].
#      - First write a function that takes in a list of any two values, then
#        calculates the rest of the sequence starting from that point.  It
#        should have two arguments:  the starting list and the number of 
#        additional Fibonacci sequence elements to calculate.
#      - Second, turn this into a class that takes the same list at start,
#        but has a method that takes only the number of additional Fibonacci 
#        sequence elements as an argument and then calculates the sequence.
#  Note that technically the Fibonacci sequence starts at 0, but for our
#  coding practice we can calculate it from any two starting values.
